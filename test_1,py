The program is trying to determine the best payment option. 
The first payment option is for $100 a day for 10 days
The second payment option is for $1 the first day, $2 the second day and so on until it has reached 10 days.
Find a solution to see which option produces the most money at the 10th day or see if they are the same.

Fuction1 will output 100 * 10

Function2 will loop 10 times, each time doubling, and add the amount to the total

If the total amounts ae equal, we output to the user, "Option 1 and Option 2 are the same"
If option 1 is better, we output to the user, "Option 1 is better"
If option 2 is better, we output to the user, "Option 2 is better"
